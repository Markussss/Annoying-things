What and why
------------

- **Facebook**
  - *Filter goal*: To only see *real* posts made by friends on Facebook, preferably text, image or video posts.
  - Posts that only contain information about a friend engaging with another post on Facebook
  - Other "annoying" content, defined by my subjective experience of Facebook
- **YouTube**
  - *Filter goal*: Hide videos with a low likelihood of being *enjoyable* from video suggestions, even though they might be clicked or be interesting.
  - Already watched videos on YouTube that YouTube shows that you already have watched, by showing a red bar below the video
  - Short videos (less than 1 minute) on YouTube
  - Playlists based on videos you have watched on YouTube (Mix-playlists)
- **Google**
  - *Filter goal*: See as relevant search results as possible
  - Video search tab now only links to YouTube (Still considering allowing other websites)
  - Do not show search results from W3Schools, as they are usually not very useful but rank high
- **Twitter**
  - *Filter goal*: Remove social network parts of Twitter, while keeping the "Follow"-buttons on each profile.
  - No more retweets
  - Remove "Who to follow" and "Topics to follow" suggestions
