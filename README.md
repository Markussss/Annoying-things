# Annoying things

A small filter list for uBlock Origin set to block things I find annoying online

Things that are supposed to be removed by this filter list are:
- Posts on Facebook that only contain information about some friend engaging with another post on Facebook.
- Already watched videos on YouTube
- Playlists based on videos you have watched on YouTube (Mix-playlists)
- W3Schools search results on Google.
